## ðŸ“Š Health Care Service Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project explores key aspects of health care service delivery with the aim of maintaining high-quality patient care while improving efficiency. The analysis focuses on three main areas:

- **Patient Length of Stay (LOS):** Evaluates average hospital stays and includes a root cause analysis to identify factors influencing extended or shortened stays (e.g., patient demographics, diagnosis types, and treatment complexity).  
- **Cost Analysis:** Reviews healthcare costs across services and departments, with an in-depth look at what drives high or low costs, including length of stay, procedure types, and hospital-specific practices.  
- **Hospital Comparison:** Highlights performance differences between hospitals to support benchmarking and guide improvement strategies.

This dashboard equips healthcare administrators with actionable insights to enhance patient outcomes and streamline operations.
